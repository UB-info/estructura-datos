ESTRUCTURA DE DADES (UB) - ENTREGA 4
====================================

## Usage

Run the file `ColaInterface.py` or `PColaInterface.py` to load the program using the `Queue` or `PriorityQueue` class respectively.

## Requirements

This software requires the files listed below:

 - LastFM_big.dat
 - LastFM_small.dat

## Running the Benchmarks

In order to perform benchmarks, I provide a `benchmark.py` file. The file shows an output like as follows:

```
In Queue, the average time spent in adding is 143.6ms and 31.43ms in searching.
In PriorityQueue, the average time spent in adding is 555.9ms and 6.664ms in searching.
Conclusion: add in PriorityQueue is 3.872 times slower but search is 4.716 times faster.
```
