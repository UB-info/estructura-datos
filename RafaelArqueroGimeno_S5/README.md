ESTRUCTURA DE DADES (UB) - ENTREGA 5
====================================

## Usage

Run the file `PColaInterface.py` or `ABBInterface.py` to load the program using the `PriorityQueue` or `ABB` class respectively.

## Requirements

This software requires the files listed below:

 - LastFM_big.dat
 - LastFM_small.dat

## Running the Benchmarks

In order to perform benchmarks, I provide a `benchmark.py` file. The file shows an output like as follows:

```
In Binary Search Tree, the average time spent in adding is 1.186e+03ms and 29.61ms in searching.
In Priority Queue, the average time spent in adding is 4.035e+03ms and 3.532ms in searching.

Conclusion: add is 3.404 times slower in Priority Queue, but search is 8.383 times faster.
```
